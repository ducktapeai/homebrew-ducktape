# DuckTape ðŸ¦† - Your Personal TimeAI

DuckTape is an AI-powered command-line interface that simplifies managing your Apple Calendar, Reminders, and Notes. With DuckTape, you can use two distinct approaches: **Natural Language Mode** and **Terminal Mode**.

> **Note**: DuckTape currently only works on macOS and requires Apple Calendar, Reminders, and Notes to be properly configured on your system. [Learn how to set up Apple Calendar](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/set-up-icloud-calendar-icl1022/mac).
> DuckTape will use your native Apple capabilities, for example Apple Contacts, Apple Reminders and so forth. Please ensure these Applications are properly setup and configured.

## Getting Started

DuckTape offers two modes of operation:

### 1. Natural Language Mode (Requires API Key)

In this mode, DuckTape uses AI language models to interpret natural language commands. This requires setting up API keys for one of the supported AI providers.

#### Setting Up API Keys

Choose at least one provider and set the corresponding environment variable:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'

# For Grok (X.AI)
export XAI_API_KEY='your-xai-api-key-here'

# For DeepSeek
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your-deepseek-api-key-here'
```

To make these changes persistent, add them to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`).

#### Running in Natural Language Mode

1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `ducktape` and press enter to start the interactive Natural Language terminal:
   ```bash
   ducktape
   ```
3. You'll see a welcome message. Then type your request using natural language:
   ```
   ðŸ¦† create a zoom event today at 10am called Team Check in and invite Joe Duck
   ```
4. DuckTape will process your natural language request and execute the appropriate command:
   ```
   Processing natural language: 'create a zoom event today at 10am called Team Check in and invite Joe Duck'
   Translated to command: ducktape calendar create "Team Check in" 2025-04-22 10:00 11:00 "Work" --email "joe.duck@example.com" --contacts "Joe Duck" --zoom
   ```

The power of Natural Language Mode is that it automatically interprets dates, times, and contacts, saving you time and effort.

### 2. Terminal Mode (No API Key Required)

In this mode, DuckTape operates as a traditional command-line interface (CLI) where you directly execute structured commands without requiring any API keys.

```bash
ducktape calendar create "Team Meeting" 2025-04-15 13:00 14:00 "Work" --contacts "Joe Duck" --zoom
```

This command explicitly specifies all parameters: event title, date, start time, end time, calendar name, contacts, and the zoom flag to create a meeting link.

## Configuration

DuckTape uses a `config.toml` file to manage its settings:

```toml
[language_model]
provider = "Grok"  # Options: "OpenAI", "Grok", "DeepSeek", or leave empty for Terminal Mode

[calendar]
default_calendar = "Work"
default_reminder_minutes = 15
default_duration_minutes = 60

[reminder]
default_list = "Reminders"
default_reminder = true

[notes]
default_folder = "Notes"
```

### Viewing and Editing Configuration
- To view the current configuration:
  ```bash
  ducktape config show all
  ```
- To change settings via command line:
  ```bash
  ducktape config set language_model.provider "grok"
  ```

For complete configuration details, see [ducktapeai.com/docs/config.html](https://ducktapeai.com/docs/config.html).

## Advanced Features

### Zoom Integration
DuckTape can create Zoom meetings directly from both Terminal Mode and Natural Language Mode.

Set up Zoom integration with:
```bash
export ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID='your-zoom-account-id'
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID='your-zoom-client-id'
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET='your-zoom-client-secret'
```

For more details on Zoom integration, see [ducktapeai.com/docs/zoom.html](https://ducktapeai.com/docs/zoom.html).

### Contact Integration

DuckTape integrates with Apple Contacts to automatically look up email addresses:

```bash
ducktape calendar create "Project Discussion" 2025-04-23 14:00 15:00 "Work" --contacts "Joe Duck, Jane Doe"
```

Or in Natural Language Mode:
```
ðŸ¦† schedule a meeting with Joe Duck and Jane Doe tomorrow at 2pm
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Missing API Keys**: Ensure you have set the required environment variables for your chosen language model provider.
- **Invalid Calendar Name**: Use `ducktape calendar list` to see available calendars.
- **Contact Not Found**: Verify that the contact exists in your Apple Contacts app.
- **Zoom Integration Issues**: Check that your Zoom API credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.

DuckTape provides detailed logging information that can help diagnose issues:
